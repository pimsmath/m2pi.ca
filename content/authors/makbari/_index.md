I am a PhD candidate at the University of Ottawa, specializing in discrete mathematics with a focus on cycle decomposition. I obtained my M.Sc. in Applied Mathematics from the same institution. While I enjoy doing research in pure mathematics and teaching, I am also passionate about learning new things, exploring other research areas, and applying my knowledge to solve real-life problems in industry.
