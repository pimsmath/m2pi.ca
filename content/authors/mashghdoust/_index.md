I’m a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Manitoba with a
strong background in algorithms, geometric computing, and problem-solving. I’m
especially interested in applying AI and data-driven methods to optimize
complex systems. Outside of research, I enjoy playing different instruments,
building intuitive tools, and tackling real-world tech challenges.
