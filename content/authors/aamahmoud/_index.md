I am a mathematician and a physicist. I have a subtle background in various
areas of mathematics and physics including: Quantum physics, PDEs, computational
physics, mathematical modeling, and mathematical physics. Furthermore, I have
outstanding programming skills as I am proficient in Python, Matlab, and Wolfram
Mathematica. Currently, I am aiming at continuing my education and building a
career in the rapidly emerging field of data science.
