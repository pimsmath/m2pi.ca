I am currently pursuing an MSc in Data Science with a specialization in Data,
Modelling, and Prediction at the University of Alberta. My study focuses on
statistical inference, statistical and economic modeling, and statistical
machine learning. I have the ability to apply statistical techniques to identify
patterns and correlations in data and lead to data-driven recommendations.
