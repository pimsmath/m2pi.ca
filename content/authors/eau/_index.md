Hello, I'm Emily Au! I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Mathematical and Statistical Sciences. I enjoy learning about and investigating new topics in Mathematical Modelling and Machine Learning. I look forward to applying my mathematics and computing skills to solve real-life challenges.

More about me is that I love exploring nature and going hiking. The beautiful views of nature calm me down.
