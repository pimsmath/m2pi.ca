Noah is a recent graduate student from the University of Ottawa studying the effects of seasonaility on predator-prey scenarios. His work focuses on bistability and bifurcations
in ordinary differential equation models as well as averaging of discontinuous systems. He works mainly with MATLAB, Python, R and XPPAUTO. His
interests lie in mathematical ecology, mainly in population dynamics, as well as mathematical modelling and numerical simulations applied to various real-world scenarios.
