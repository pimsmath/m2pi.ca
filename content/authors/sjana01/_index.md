I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of British Columbia with research
interests in the field of Algebraic Topology. More specifically I am interested
in Spaces of Homomorphisms, Group Cohomology, and Topological Data Analysis. I
am also an aspiring Data Scientist with added interest in Machine Learning and
Deep Learning. I am interested in neural networks and their applications in
Image Processing, Computer Vision, Linguistics, and NLP. I have experience with
machine learning libraries such as Scikit-learn, Keras, TensorFlow, et cetera,
and visualization libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly in Python.
