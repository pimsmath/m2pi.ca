I am a Ph.D. candidate in Mathematics with a research focus on Algebraic Topology. I am a highly motivated and skilled individual passionate about using mathematics to solve real-world problems. With expertise in complex mathematical concepts, I am eager to apply my knowledge to solve industry problems. I have been involved in several projects over the past few years, showcasing my ability to apply mathematical concepts to real-world problems. My strong analytical skills, problem-solving ability, experience in data analysis, and expertise in Machine Learning make me a valuable asset to any team. In my Ph.D. research, I have been studying the homological properties of the "Classifying Spaces for Commutativity in Unitary Groups" and the "Unordered Flag Manifolds". I have recently found a profound interest in Quantum Computation. I believe it has the potential to impact a wide range of fields, including cryptography, drug discovery, artificial intelligence, and financial modeling. I am highly motivated and committed to continuously learning and expanding my knowledge in Data Science and Quantum Computation. I am eager to contribute my expertise to a company dedicated to using mathematics to solve real-world problems and drive innovation in these fields.
