I am a postdoctoral fellow at UBC, with a joint appointment at the Sauder School
of Business and the Department of Computer Science. I completed my PhD at
Université Grenoble Alpes under the supervision of András Sebő, where I
developed a deep interest in discrete geometry and integer programming—central
themes in my research.
