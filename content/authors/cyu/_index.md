C is graduating from the University of Toronto's mathematics masters program in
2023. Their interests lie in algebraic topology and homotopy theory, but they
are developing an interest in machine learning and neural networks. They
enjoy learning from people of all different disciplines and backgrounds
and hope to apply their math skills to solve real world problems.
