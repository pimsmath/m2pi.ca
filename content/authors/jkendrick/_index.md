I am a PhD student in the mathematics department of the University of Washington, where I work on mathematical problems inspired by machine learning and data science. Most recently, I have been interested in exploiting algebraic structure in data, such as symmetry, to make complicated problems more simple. I am also really interested in practicing data science and I am always excited by the ways in which data can be used to solve real world problems.
