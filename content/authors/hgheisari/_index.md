I am currently a number theory master's student at the University of Lethbridge.
I am working on the Frobenius primality test based on cubic polynomials, which
is applied to cryptographic concepts. I got my first master's and bachelor's
from the University of Tehran, which is the first-rank university in Iran.
Mathematics was my first passion when I was 10 years old, and I have pursued it
since then. I believe there is no boundary in mathematics, and we can broaden
the science horizons and enbridge scientific fields by understanding the
mathematics concepts.
