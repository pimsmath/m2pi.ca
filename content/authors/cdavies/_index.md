I am currently a PhD candidate working in the field of optimal transportation, working under the supervision of Professor Robert McCann. Currently, my research touches on a number of aspects related to optimal transportation, including aggregation models, synthetic geometry, general relativity, and mathematical economics. In my spare time, I like to hone my coding skills by practicing on problems like those from Advent of Code. I have greatly enjoyed working on a M2PI project with Awesense this summer, as I have gotten to apply my mathematical knowledge to a real-world problem, work with a dedicated and motivated team, and learn about how to work with large amounts of data. I anticipate to graduate in August 2025 and, upon graduation, I am aiming to put my mathematical training to use in either consulting or tech. As of writing, I am open for paid internship opportunities in Summer 2024, so if my skills and work seem like a match, don't hesitate to reach out!
