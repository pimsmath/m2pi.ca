 I have a bachelor’s degree in Actuarial Science from the Meritorious Autonomous
 University of Puebla (BUAP), where I gained experience as a research
 collaborator, particularly in programming and data analysis. In January 2025, I
 began a Master’s program in Modeling, Data, and Prediction at the University of
 Alberta. I hold several Google certifications in data analysis, covering topics
 such as regression, machine learning, and deep learning. I am proficient in R,
 Python, and VBA, and have basic knowledge of SQL.
