My postgraduate work started with a survey of algebro-geometric methods applied
to partial differential equations during my master's. I then did research in
number theory during my PhD, where I worked on problems about the Riemann zeta
function. During my postdoctoral studies, my research expanded to involve other
L-functions, and also elliptic curves. I am now pursuing a career in industry,
and want to apply my computing skills and use my mathematical background to
work on problems in post quantum cryptography, where several fields of
mathematics meet.
