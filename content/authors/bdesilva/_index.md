I completed my special degree in Mathematics and Statistics with Second Class
Upper Division Honours in 2012. Over the past decade, I have gained valuable
academic experience through my roles as a Lecturer, Instructor, and Tutorial
Instructor, while also engaging in research in Applied Mathematics and
Statistics. My work has resulted in the publication of four abstracts and one
journal article. Building on this background, I completed a Master's degree in
Applied Mathematics, where I conducted research on a mathematical model for the
Notch Signalling Pathway. Currently, I am doing a Masterâ€™s degree in
Biochemistry and working as a Graduate Assistant at the University of
Lethbridge, Canada.
