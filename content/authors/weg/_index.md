I am currently a first-year biostatistics graduate student at University of
Saskatchewan. My research area is two-part models dealing with micro-genomic
data. I obtained my Bachelor degree of Science at Simon Fraser University (SFU)
as a mathematics honour student, with research interest in Riemann surfaces.
