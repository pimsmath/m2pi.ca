I have a Ph.D. in Mathematics from Cinevestv-IPN in Mexico, where I conducted research on non-archimedean networks and image processing. I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Alberta, where I apply my expertise in biology, mathematics, and satellite image processing to evaluate air and water quality. I am passionate about solving real-world problems using machine-learning techniques and satellite imagery.
