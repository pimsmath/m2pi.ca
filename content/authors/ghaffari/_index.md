Doctoral degree (Ph.D.) in Space Physics specializing in geospace physics- a
complex and highly dynamic environment with no direct access- by processing and
analyzing in-situ and remote sensing data sets (satellites and ground-based
instruments) and also modelling atmospheric impacts for applications such as
radio communication. Experienced in research, problem-solving, critical
thinking, atmospheric modelling, strong teamwork skills, highly interested in
new challenges, and looking to learn. Experienced in Laboratory operation and
supervision as well.
