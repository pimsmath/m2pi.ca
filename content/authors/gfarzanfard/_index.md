I'm a graduate student pursuing my studies in Number Theory at Lethbridge
University. My research is currently focussed on Zero density for the Riemann
Zeta function. Prior to my enrolment at Lethbridge University I completed a
bachelor's degree in Mathematics at Shahid Beheshti University which is one of
the most prestigious universities in Iran. I am excited to contribute my
mathematical knowledge to solve real-world problems.
