I’m a graduate student pursuing my studies in Analytical Number Theory at Lethbridge University. My research is currently focussed on zero density for the Riemann Zeta function. Prior to my enrolment at Lethbridge University I completed a bachelor’s degree in Mathematics at Shahid Beheshti University in Iran. I am excited to contribute my mathematical knowledge to solve real-world problems.
