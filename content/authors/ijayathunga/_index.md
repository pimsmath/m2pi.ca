I am currently pursuing a masterâ€™s degree in Mathematics in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Calgary. My research focuses on developing higher order numerical methods for solving the Helmholtz equation. Additionally, I am involved in a research project that explores Mathematics Teaching and Learning. 
I look forward to exploring and applying my knowledge, skills, and experience to solve real-world applications.
