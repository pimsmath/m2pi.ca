I am a Master's student in mathematics and have a well rounded background in
computer science. In my spare time I like to learn about design and work on
personal projects. I believe that empathy is the most important skill when
endeavoring on any problem solving task, because if you fail to relate to or
understand your target audience then you will likely fail to provide a solution
that works for them. I'm very interested in information visualization and would
love to continue developing my skills in this area. I also have skills and
experience working with databases, writing web servers, data munging, writing
shaders, and a variety of other things. Additionally, I'm always interested in
learning new skills. The most fulfilling type of work, for me, is work that is
meaningful to people.
