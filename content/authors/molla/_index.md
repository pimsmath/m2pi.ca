Currently, I am pursuing my Ph.D. in the field of Financial Mathematics. The
main area of my research is coupled forward-backward stochastic differential
equations (FBSDEs) that may arise from the Stochastic Optimal Control problems
and the Mean-Field Game systems. I study coupled FBSDEs in the general nonlinear
and non-markovian settings. And thus it has applications in challenging
real-life problems like financial derivative pricing and portfolio management
problems. Machine learning algorithms play an important role in my research as
they are very useful for numerical approximations of coupled FBSDEs.
