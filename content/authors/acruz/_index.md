I am a recent graduate from the University of British Columbia, where I studied
harmonic analysis and fractal geometry. Although my doctoral work is rooted in
pure mathematics, the Math to Power Industry experience opened my eyes to the
many options in industry that I have yet to explore. Going forward, I will
explore opportunities as they come while searching for projects that involve
signal processing.
