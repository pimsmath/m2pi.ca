I am currently a postdoctoral scholar at the University of Guelph investigating
problems in quantum walks, spectral graph theory, and graph domination.
Previously, I was a PIMS Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Manitoba. In
the past I have also worked on problems in design theory, graph colouring, and
data analysis. I seek new challenges and opportunities to apply my knowledge and
skills.
