I am passionate about data analysis and uncovering insightful patterns and information. My favorite areas within this diverse field are risk analysis and time series analysis.

Currently, I am a part-time math and statistics instructor at Niagara College. I have completed my master's degree in mathematics with a focus on game theory and dynamical systems. My thesis centered on stability and equilibrium convergence analysis for multi-agent populations.

I hold a BSc degree in Computer Science, where I worked on mechanism design and auctions.
