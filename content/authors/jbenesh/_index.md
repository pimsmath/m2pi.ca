My academic achievements include an MSc. in Mathematics from the University of
Lethbridge, specializing in Algebraic Geometry and Representation Theory,
particularly focused on the Langlands program. I hold a BSc.h. in Mathematics
from the University of Saskatchewan, with a concentration in Pure Mathematics
and a minor in Physics. Driven by my passion for mathematics, physics, data
science, and machine learning, I am eager to contribute my skills and knowledge
to solve interesting problems and drive positive change in cutting-edge
projects.
