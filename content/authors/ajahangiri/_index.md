I am currently a second-year graduate student studying Statistics at the University of Calgary. My research broadly revolves around the analysis of high-dimensional data using machine learning models. Specifically, I am currently working on supervised binary classification of high-dimensional data sets with rare and weak signals.

Part of my passion involves applying my mathematical and statistical skills to exploring and answering 'Why' questions in the world of data.
