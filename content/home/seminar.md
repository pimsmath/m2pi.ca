We are pleased to present the 2025-2026 [Math to Power Industry: Case Studies
Virtual Seminar
Series](https://www.pims.math.ca/resources/publications/math-power-industry).
This initiative supports our mandate to foster meaningful engagement between the
mathematical sciences and sectors beyond academia. 

In this series we will highlight collaborative research between members of the
PIMS academic community—graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and faculty—and
partners in industry, government, non-profit organizations, and other sectors
across western Canada.   Presenters will share case studies that reflect on:


  * the research process, outcomes, and lessons learned, including challenges,
    and unexpected results.
  * key moments of discovery during these collaborations.
