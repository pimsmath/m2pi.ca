M2PI brings together industrial partners facing challenging mathematical problems
and the mathematical talent needed to tackle them. In a focused 3-week workshop,
teams of highly trained mathematicians will help you understand and attempt to
solve them.

### How it works

* Partners (you!) submit problems based on challenges facing your organization,
  which might have significant mathematical aspects.
* Graduate students and postdocs receive training from M2PI on applying their mathematical
  skills to real-world problems.
* Small teams of these M2PI trainees (led by a mentor from your organization) apply their
  mathematical expertise to produce viable solutions during an intensive two-week
  sprint.

The outcome is fresh insight into solving the challenges facing your
organization. The project teams distill their work into written reports and
presentations which you can use directly, or as the foundation to build new
partnerships and innovations.

<h5>More Details</h5>
Participating in M2PI as a partner is <b>free</b>, all we ask is that you
provide a problem relevant to your organization and 2-3 hours per day of your
(or a colleague's) time to act as a mentor during the last 2 weeks of the
program (June 1-12). Good problems for M2PI are typically:

 * Easy to describe to non-experts
 * Contain significant mathematical science content (broadly construed)
 * Stand-alone and do not require extensive background research
 * Likely to yield significant progress within 2–3 weeks of work
 * Suitable to be tackled individually or by a small team
 * Appropriate for public presentation (i.e., not restricted by IP or other privacy requirements)

If you think you have a problem which might fit this pattern, or if you want to
find out more, please fill out the [project application
form](https://ubc.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_ethahN004YSRFjw) and we'll be in
touch.
