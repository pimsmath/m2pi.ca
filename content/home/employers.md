From **May 5-23, 2025** PIMS is hosting a virtual workshop called Math to Power
Industry (M2PI 2025). This program pairs industry problems with mathematical talent,
benefiting both M2PI participants and our industry partners by tackling real world
problems. We are currently accepting problem statements for M2PI
2025.  To see examples of problems from previous years, _and the solutions provided by
M2PI participants_, please see our [past editions](#editions) pages.  If
you would like to submit a problem please complete our [problem
submission form](https://survey.ucalgary.ca/jfe/form/SV_0MVrmUR4gJ6BEpM).

If you would like to submit a job opportunity to the M2PI community or have
another questions about the M2PI program, please [contact us](#contact).

### How it works

* Organizations are invited to submit challenges for teams of graduate students
  and postdoctoral fellows to tackle during the workshop.
* PIMS matches your organization to an academic researcher who can provide
  support for developing the problem statement.
* Students complete various training courses in a variety of professional and
  technical skills relevant to STEM careers.
* Mentors from the organization work closely with the student team for the
  remainder of the workshop. Mentors typically meet with the students for a
  minimum of two hours each day during this time.
* Participants present the results of their work at a graduation ceremony and
  networking event.

The intended outcome of M2PI is that partner organizations will have the
opportunity to engage with highly skilled talent, while also receiving
innovative solutions to the math challenge submitted to the workshop.

We encourage mentors from your organization to connect with student participants
at the M2PI graduation event on May 28th (see the [PIMS Event
Page](https://www.pims.math.ca/events/250528-2mtpimge) for registration details)
This event will also offer partner organizations the chance to present job
openings, internships, and other career opportunities to students.  Additionally
industry partners will be able leverage the M2PI network to help fill internship
and permanent positions during and after the workshop through M2PIâ€™s
communication channels.
