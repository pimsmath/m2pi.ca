During **June 4-24, 2024** PIMS is holding a virtual workshop called Math to
Power Industry.  We are currently accepting problem statements from employers
who would like to submit a project to the workshop.  If you would like to submit
a problem or showcase a job opportunity, please contact us by completing the
[contact form below](#contact).

### How it works

* Organizations are invited to submit challenges for teams of graduate students
  and postdoctoral fellows to tackle during the workshop.
* PIMS matches your organization to an academic researcher who can provide
  support for developing the problem statement.
* Students complete various training courses in a variety of professional and
  technical skills relevant to STEM careers.
* Mentors from the organization work closely with the student team for the
  remainder of the workshop. Mentors typically meet with the students for a
  minimum of two hours each day during this time.
* Efforts will be made to link organizations to talent during and beyond the
  workshop for the purpose of filling internship or permanent positions.

The intended outcome is that partner organizations will have the opportunity to
engage with highly skilled talent, while also receiving innovative solutions to
the math challenge submitted to the workshop. You can see examples of successful
projects on the [2023 M2PI website](/2023/).
