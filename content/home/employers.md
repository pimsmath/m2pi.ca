During **July 10 - 31 2023** PIMS is holding a virtual workshop called Math to Power
Industry.  We are currently accepting problem statements from employers who
would like to submit a project to the workshop.  If you would like to submit a
problem or showcase a job opportunity, please contact Kristine Bauer
(industry@pims.math.ca) or use the [contact form below](#contact).

### How it works

* Organizations are invited to submit green-themed math challenges for teams of
  graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to tackle during the workshop.
* PIMS matches your organization to an academic researcher who can provide
  support for developing the problem statement.
* Organizations provide mentors to work closely with the team during **July 17-27**.
  During **July 17-19**, teams will meet in person either on site or at a local PIMS
  host university.  During **July 20-27**, teams work virtually and need to have
  access to a mentor from your organization for minimum of two hours per day.
  Mentors are welcome to work more closely with the team if desired.
* During the workshop our graduate student and postdoc participants will also
  receive professional and technical skills training relevant to non-academic
  STEM careers.
* Efforts will be made to link organizations to talent during and beyond the
  workshop for the purpose of filling internship or permanent positions.

We suggest that organizations provide a $1000 stipend for each of the four
students on their team, similar to an intern salary.  This will help to recruit
exceptional teams of students.  This is not a requirement for participating in
M2PI, and there is no other cost for employer partners to participate in the
program.

The intended outcome is that partner organizations will have the opportunity to
engage with highly skilled talent, while also receiving innovative solutions to
the math challenge submitted to the workshop. You can see examples of successful
projects on the 2022 M2PI website.
