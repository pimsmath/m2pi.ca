M2PI pairs industrial partners who have interesting mathematical problems with
mathematical talent. This arrangement benefits both M2PI participants and our
industry partners by tackling real world problems with cutting edge mathematics.
If you work in industry and have a problem which sounds like it might be a good
fit for the M2PI program, or if you have any other questions please [contact
us](#contact).

&nbsp;

### How it works

* Organizations are invited to submit challenges for teams of graduate students
  and postdoctoral fellows to tackle during the workshop.
* PIMS matches your organization to an academic researcher who can provide
  support for developing the problem statement.
* Students complete various training courses in a variety of professional and
  technical skills relevant to STEM careers.
* Mentors from the organization work closely with the student team for the
  remainder of the workshop. Mentors typically meet with the students for a
  minimum of two hours each day during this time.
* Participants present the results of their work at a graduation ceremony and
  networking event.

The intended outcome of M2PI is that partner organizations will have the
opportunity to engage with highly skilled talent, while also receiving
innovative solutions to the math challenge submitted to the workshop.
