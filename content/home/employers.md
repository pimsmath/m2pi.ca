M2PI brings together industrial partners with challenging mathematical problems
and the mathematical talent needed to tackle them. Partners gain fresh insight
grounded in cutting-edge mathematics, while trainees gain hands-on experience
with meaningful industrial projects. If you’re part of an industry, government,
or non-profit organization in Western Canada and have a problem that could
benefit from a mathematical perspective, we’d be delighted to [hear from
you](#contact).

### How it works

* Organizations are invited to submit challenges for teams of graduate students
  and postdoctoral fellows to tackle during the workshop.
* PIMS matches your organization to an academic researcher who can provide
  support for developing the problem statement.
* Students complete various training courses in a variety of professional and
  technical skills relevant to STEM careers.
* Mentors from the organization work closely with the student team for the
  remainder of the workshop, typically meet with the students for a minimum of
  two hours each day during this time.
* Participants present the results of their work at a graduation ceremony and
  networking event.

The intended outcomes of M2PI are that partner organizations will have the
opportunity to engage with highly skilled talent and will receive innovative
solutions to the mathematical challenges they face.

_If you have any questions about the program, or think you might want to submit a
