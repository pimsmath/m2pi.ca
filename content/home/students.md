M2PI is a full-time training and work-integrated learning opportunity for
graduate students and post-doctoral fellows in the mathematical sciences
(undergraduate students are also eligible to apply). Successful applicants will
be asked to commit to full-time participation from **May 5-23, 2025**.
They will receive professional and technical training and will work in groups on
their industry problems with an industry mentor.

  * In the first two weeks, students will receive professional and technical
    skills training relevant to non-academic STEM careers through virtual
    courses.
  * Following training, teams continue their work virtually and have access to a
    mentor.
  * As the conclusion, there will be an in-person graduation event and career
    fair (tentatively scheduled for May 26th).  Students and postdoctoral
    participants will receive a travel grant to attend this event.  M2PI Fellows
    will have the opportunity to meet employers, learn about careers involving
    mathematics, and learn about job opportunities.

Following the workshop, your work will be showcased at a virtual graduation
event. Participants will showcase their skills to a large audience including
potential employers in both academic and non-academic fields.  Examples of
previous successful projects on the [2024 Math to Power Industry
page](/2024/#projects).

Student applications will open in _January 2025_.  Students should [join our mailing
list](https://eepurl.com/hF9Wnf) to be notified as soon as applications are
open.
