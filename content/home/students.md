  * In the first two weeks, students will receive professional and technical
    skills training relevant to non-academic STEM careers via virtual
    courses.
  * Following the training, teams will convene virtually and work intensively on
    their projects. During this time, they will have access to a mentor for
    guidance.
  * The program will conclude with an in-person graduation event and career
    fair _(tentatively scheduled for May 26)_. Students and postdoctoral
    participants will receive travel grants to attend, giving them the
    opportunity to network with employers, explore careers that leverage
    mathematical skills, and learn about available job opportunities.

Following the workshop, participants' work will be showcased at a virtual graduation
event and published in the form of a report. At the graduation event,
participants will showcase their skills to a large audience including potential
employers in both academic and non-academic fields.

Student applications will open in **_March 2025_**. In the
meantime, please [join our mailing list](https://eepurl.com/hF9Wnf) to stay up
