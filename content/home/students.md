M2PI is a full-time training and work-integrated learning opportunity for
graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in the mathematical sciences
(undergraduate students are also eligible to apply). Successful applicants will
commit to full-time participation for the duration of the workshop (3 weeks), during
which they will receive specialized professional and technical training while
collaborating in teams on industry-specific problems under the
guidance of an industry mentor.

During the workshop, you will:

  * Receive training and build professional skills in digital collaboration,
communication, teamwork, and ethics
  * Work full-time in a small team on a real-world problem proposed by an industry partner
  * Apply mathematical and analytical skills to a business or organizational challenge
  * Collaborate with and receive guidance from mentors outside academia
  * Present your team’s work to peers and industry representatives
