M2PI is a full-time training and work-integrated learning opportunity for
graduate students and post-doctoral fellows in the mathematical sciences
(undergraduate students are also eligible to apply). Successful applicants will
be asked to commit to full-time participation during **May 5-23, 2025**, during
which time they will participate in training and work in groups on their
industry problems.

  * In the first two weeks, students will receive professional and technical
    skills training relevant to non-academic STEM careers through virtual
    courses.
  * Following training, teams continue their work virtually and have access to a
    mentor.
  * At the conclusion, there will be an in-person graduate event with a career
    fair tentatively scheduled for May 26th.  Students and postdoctoral fellows
    who have been admitted to the M2PI program will receive a travel grant to
    attend this event.  M2PI Fellows will have the opportunity to meet
    employers, learn about careers involving mathematics, and learn about job
    opportunities.

Following the workshop, your work will be showcased at a virtual graduation
event. Here you will showcase your skills to a large audience including
potential employers in both academic and non-academic fields. You can see
examples of successful projects on the [2024 Math to Power Industry
page](/2024/#projects).

Applications will open in January 2025.  Students should [join our mailing
list](https://eepurl.com/hF9Wnf) to be notified when applications open
