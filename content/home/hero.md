**May 5-23, 2025**

From May 5-23, 2025 the Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Sciences (PIMS)
will be running our popular Math to Power Industry workshop (M2PI 2025). This
hybrid workshop pairs industry problems with mathematical talent, aiming to
benefit both trainees participating in the program and our industrial partners.
If you are interested in participating as either a trainee or as an industry
partner, please select one of the options below for more details.
