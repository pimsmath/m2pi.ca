We are pleased to present the 2025-2026 Math to Power Industry: Case Studies
Virtual Seminar Series. This initiative supports our mandate to foster
meaningful engagement between the mathematical sciences and sectors beyond
academia. 

In this series we will highlight collaborative research between members of the
PIMS academic community—graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and faculty—and
partners in industry, government, non-profit organizations, and other sectors
across western Canada.   Presenters will share case studies that reflect on:

 * the research process, outcomes, and lessons learned, including challenges, and unexpected results.
 * key moments of discovery during these collaborations.
