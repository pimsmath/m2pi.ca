title: "Python Training in Numpy & Pandas"
authors: 
  - iana

summary: |
  Participants will be trained in the use of [numpy](https://numpy.org/) and
  [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/). This course will serve as a foundation
  for further courses on machine learning (e.g. sklearn) which will in turn
  provide participants with a solid general purpose toolset for
  data-analysis and developing data-science pipelines for practical problems.

### Course Description
This course will build on your knowledge of Python to sharpen your skills for
data manipulation and analysis. Please read through the  material in our [self
study repository](https://github.com/ianabc/m2pi-python-self-study) before this
course to get an idea of the sorts of things we will be assuming.

We ask that you spend some time brushing up on your Python programming skills
before the workshop begins. Python is very user friendly and easy to learn as
you go. The [python documentation](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide)
has lots of links to learning resources; if you have no programming experience,
[this list](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers) should
help you find some suitable tutorials, if you have some programming experience
in another language, [this
list](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Programmers) should help you
find some useful tutorials. Here are a few examples from those lists

* [Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python)
* [Google's Python Class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/)
* [Learnpython.org](http://Learnpython.org)

Some of these resources will let you run python snippets as part of the tutorial
and you should also ensure you can access [google
collab](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/) (requires a google
account) which will persist after the workshop and can let you work
collaboratively with other people. If you prefer to install things locally,
[miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or
[anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) is probably the best
way to do that. Your goals when working through the python tutorials should be
to understand. This class will assume you are familiar with python syntax,
loops, functions, module and classes. We will begin by exploring the [numpy
module](https://numpy.org/) for fast numerical operations as a foundation for learning more about
data manipulation with the [pandas module](https://pandas.pydata.org/).
Depending on how far we get with these modules, we will try to look at some toy
problems and more realistic applications, similar to what you might see in the
coming weeks.
