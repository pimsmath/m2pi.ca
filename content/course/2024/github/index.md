### Course Description
Git is a powerful version control system allowing to record, access, and restore
the history of projects. After setting up remotes on the internet or other
network, Git is also a mighty collaboration tool.

In this workshop, we will:
  * setup a repo in two scenarios
  * create a repo on GitHub
  * convert a local folder into a git repository, and publish to GitHub 
  * make clones
  * clone to a computer
  * clone to OverLeaf
  * make changes and commit them
  * push the commits to GitHub
  * syncing changes directly from Overleaf
  * learn a workflow for collaboration
  * fork an existing GitHub repo
  * prepare a pull request
  * deal with conflicts

Time permitting, we will cover branches.  Following the instructional portion of
this course, there will be time dedicated to exercising and Dr. Ma will be
available to answer questions.
