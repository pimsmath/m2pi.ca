### Description
#### Part 1: Communicating Math Research: Clarity, Concision and Comprehension
How do you present your research without relying primarily on discussing the
technical details?  How do you meet the audience, be it general or expert, where
they are when discussing your research?  How do you promote yourself as a
researcher or an employee?  This session will discuss these questions and
effective communication strategies.

#### Part 2: Communicating Effectively in Math Industry Report Writing
By the end of this session, participants will be able to:
  * Think intentionally about writing reports for math industry
  * Apply strategies to communicate mathematics to non-experts effectively
  * Be mindful of audiencesâ€™ perspectives and needs as readers
