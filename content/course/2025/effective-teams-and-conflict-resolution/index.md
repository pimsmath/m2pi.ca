inherent challenges, including misunderstandings, miscommunication, and
conflicts.

This interactive workshop, led by Erika Lieu and McKenna Sperry, aims to provide
foundational skills to support effective teamwork, particularly for participants
who are new to working in teams. By the end of this workshop, participants will

  * Identify personal strengths and areas for growth through reflective activities.
  * Apply practical strategies to navigate and resolve team conflicts constructively.
