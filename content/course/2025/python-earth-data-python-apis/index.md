### Course Description
The session follows on directly from the [Python - Numpy & Pandas course](../python-numpy-pandas-sklearn)
and provides hands-on experience accessing & using [NASA Earthdata
Cloud](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/) i.e., freely available satellite
data—through Pythonic APIs. We'll examine environmental risk scenarios (e.g.,
floods, wildfires) over various defined geographical regions of interest using
cloud-based infrastructure and data. The main goals are:

  * to highlight strategies for quantitative analysis through "data-proximate
    computing" (i.e., using cloud-compute resources with distributed data);
  * to build a robust foundation for generic cloud-based Jupyer/Python workflows
    using cloud-based infrastructure and NASA's publicly available Earth data;
    and
  * to empower participants to adapt and remix examples for their own
    region-specific contexts.

This session builds on the use of Python/NumPy/Pandas from the first, providing
a quick, non-comprehensive overview of using Xarray, Rasterio, Hvplot, &
Geoviews for manipulating and visualizing geospatial data. This work has been
developed as part of NASA's Open Science and Transform to Open Science (TOPS)
initiatives.
