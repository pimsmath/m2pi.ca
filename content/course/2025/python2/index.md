title: "Using NASA EarthData with Python APIs"
authors: 
  - dhavide

summary: |
  This session builds on the use of Python/Numpy/Pandas from our first course,
  and shows how these tools (and others) can be applied in scenarios similar to
  those you will see in M2PI. We will be looking at applications of these tools
  and others for geospatial providing a quick, non-comprehensive overview of
  using [Xarray](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/index.html),
  [Rasterio](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html),
  [Hvplot](https://hvplot.holoviz.org/), & [Geoviews](https://geoviews.org/) for
  manipulating and visualizing geospatial data. This work has been developed as
  part of NASA's [Open Science](https://science.nasa.gov/open-science-overview)
  and [Transform to Open Science
  (TOPS)](https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science/) initiatives.

### Course Description
This session provides hands-on experience accessing & using [NASA Earthdata
Cloud](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/) i.e., freely available satellite
dataâ€”through Pythonic APIs. We'll examine environmental risk scenarios (e.g.,
floods, wildfires) over various defined geographical regions of interest using
cloud-based infrastructure and data. The main goals are:

 * to highlight strategies for quantitative analysis through "data-proximate
   computing" (i.e., using cloud-compute resources with distributed data);
 * to build a robust foundation for generic cloud-based Jupyer/Python workflows
   using cloud-based infrastructure and NASA's publicly available Earth data;
   and
 * to empower participants to adapt and remix examples for their own
   region-specific contexts.

This session builds on the use of [Python/NumPy/Pandas from the first](/course/2025/python-numpy-pandas/), providing
a quick, non-comprehensive overview of using
[Xarray](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/index.html),
[Rasterio](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html),
[Hvplot](https://hvplot.holoviz.org/), &
[Geoviews](https://geoviews.org/) for manipulating and visualizing geospatial data. This work has been
developed as part of NASA's [Open
Science](https://science.nasa.gov/open-science-overview) and [Transform to Open Science (TOPS)](https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science/)
initiatives.
