### Course Description
Git is a powerful version control system allowing to record, access, and restore
the history of projects. After setting up remotes on the internet or other
network, Git is also a mighty collaboration tool.

In this workshop, we will:
* setup a repo in two scenarios
* create a repo on GitHub
* convert a local folder into a git repository, and publish to GitHub
* make clones
* clone to a computer
* clone to OverLeaf
* make changes and commit them
* push the commits to GitHub
* syncing changes directly from Overleaf
* learn a workflow for collaboration
* fork an existing GitHub repo
* prepare a pull request
* deal with conflicts

_Prerequisites:  time will be dedicated during the course to installing Git as needed_
