       Math to Power Industry 2022 (M2PI 2022) will take place July 11-29, 2022.
       We are now inviting non-academic partner organizations to consider
       particpation in this workshop.
       
       * Organizations are invited to submit math challenges for teams of
         graduate students and postdoctorol fellows to tackle during the
         workshop
       * PIMS matches your company to an academic researcher who can provide
         support for developing the problem statement.
       * Companies provide an industry mentor to work closely with the team
         during the workshop for a minimum of two hours per day during the last
         10 days of the workshop.  Industry mentors are welcome to work more
         closely with the team if desired.
       * During the workshop our graduate student and postdoc participants will
         also receive professional and technical skills training relevant to
         STEM careers in industry.
       * Efforts will be made to link companies to talent during and beyond the
         workshop to explore internships and other hiring needs.
