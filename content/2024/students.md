M2PI is a full-time training and work-integrated learning opportunity for
graduate students and post-doctoral fellows in the mathematical sciences.
Undergraduate students are also eligible to apply. Successful applicants will be
asked to confirm their availability for full-time participation during June
4-24, 2024

  * In the first two weeks, students will receive professional and technical
    skills training relevant to non-academic STEM careers through virtual
    courses.
  * Following training, teams continue their work virtually and have access to a
    mentor.
  * At the conclusion, there will be an in-person graduate event with a career
    fair in Calgary on June 25th.  Students and postdoctoral fellows who have
    been admitted to the M2PI program will receive a travel grant to attend this
    event.  M2PI Fellows will have the opportunity to meet employers, learn
    about careers involving mathematics, and learn about job opportunities.

Following the workshop, your work will be showcased at a virtual graduation
event. Here you will showcase your skills to a large audience including
potential employers in both academic and non-academic fields. You can see
examples of successful projects on the [2023 Math to Power Industry
page](/2023).

Applications for M2PI 2024 are now closed. We will be accepting applications for
the 2025 edition at the beginning of 2025. If you are interested in
participating in future editions as a student, please consider registering for
