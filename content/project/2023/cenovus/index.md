Cenovus is a Canadian-based integrated energy company headquartered in Calgary.
We're committed to maximizing value by sustainably developing our assets in a
safe, innovative and cost-efficient manner, integrating environmental, social
and governance considerations into our business plans. We operate in Canada, the
United States and the Asia Pacific region. Our operations include oil sands
projects in northern Alberta, thermal and conventional crude oil and natural gas
projects across Western Canada, crude oil production offshore Newfoundland and
Labrador and natural gas and liquids production offshore China and Indonesia.
Cenovus's downstream operations include upgrading, refining and marketing
operations in Canada and the United States.

Our operations involve activities across the full value chain to develop,
transport, produce and market crude oil and natural gas in Canada and
internationally. Our physically integrated upstream and downstream operations
help us mitigate the impact of volatility in the market by capturing value from
production through to the sale of finished products, like gasoline, diesel, jet
fuel, asphalt and lubricants. Our existing biofuels business helps to complement
our downstream business and reduce exposure to environmental commodity markets.

Demand for clean fuels (e.g., ethanol, renewable diesel, sustainable aviation
fuel) is set to grow rapidly as new government regulations mandate fuel carbon
intensity and volumetric blending requirements. Industry needs to understand
where biogenic feedstocks may be sourced and what the corresponding carbon
intensity of these fuel pathways may be in order to meet compliance obligations
and minimize compliance costs. Development of clean fuels presents both a
business opportunity and a risk mitigation for entities that are subject to
regulatory compliance requirements.

This project will consist of data exploration to better understand large
feedstock sources and possible fuel supply-chains that maximize carbon intensity
reductions and minimize life cycle fuel supply costs. Topics in carbon
accounting, regulatory compliance, data collection, data analysis, economic
evaluation, and data visualization are expected to arise while working on this
problem.
