### Overview
Timber harvesting operations create waste biomass onsite that is not easily
utilized due to the high costs of transportation and low value of the waste
biomass. If left onsite the waste biomass would increase the fuel load and
wildfire risk in the area, therefore it is burnt in “slash-piles”. The Pacific
Institute for Climate Solutions has estimated that 5 million tonnes or 8% of BC
annual GHG emissions are due to slash-pile burning ([PICS Lightning Talks Series - Eric Nance - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcH07D0YNZw&t=99s)). One
way to significantly reduce slash-pile burning would be to increase the
economic value associated with slash-pile or the waste biomass that goes into
slash-piles. One option for increasing the economic value would be to generate
Carbon Credits by avoiding slash-pile burning, instead using the waste biomass
as feedstock for bioenergy facilities. To accomplish this, Phase I would be
the development of an accurate and verifiable method for quantifying the
reduction in carbon emissions. This would include the emissions due to
slash-pile burning, transportation and grinding emissions, bioenergy facility
emissions and the carbon value of the energy created from the biomass waste.
Phase II would be the development of an HTML calculator that could incorporate
tree species and the different fuel values associated with each, wood chip
moisture content, bioenergy facility parameters, a carbon value of the energy
produced, transportation emissions per km, grinding emissions per tonne of
biomass, slash-pile emissions per tonne of biomass waste and all associated
costs/revenue potential.
